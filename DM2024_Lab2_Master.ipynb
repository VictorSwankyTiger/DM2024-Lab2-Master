        "## 10. Large Language Models (LLMs)\n",
        "Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI models trained on vast text data to understand and generate human language. Models like GPT and BERT excel at tasks like translation, summarization, and sentiment analysis due to their deep learning techniques and large-scale training. Recently these models got popular with the rise of Open-AI's ChatGPT and their different models, showcasing the potential of these models in a lot of aspects of our current society.\n",
        "\n",
        "Open-source LLMs are cost-effective and customizable, with strong community support, but may underperform compared to paid models and require technical expertise to manage. Paid LLMs offer superior performance, ease of use, and regular updates, but are costly, less flexible, and create dependency on external providers for ongoing access and updates.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Open Source LLMs:\n",
        "In this lab we are going to use Ollama ([Ollama GitHub Link](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)), that is a library that let us use a long list of open-source LLMs of differing size. For this section we are going to be using **'llama3.2'** or **'llama3.2:1b'** for **text based tasks**, and **'llava-phi3'** for **multi-modal tasks** (e.g. image to text). Ollama has a great variety of models, and those can be found here: [model library](https://ollama.com/library). You are free to explore them if you want to try using them, you can check the advantages and disadvantages of each.\n",
        "\n",
        "Or they can also be observed in here:\n",
        "\n",
        "![pic10.png](https://github.com/didiersalazar/DM2024-Lab2-Master/blob/main/pics/pic10.png?raw=true)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In the previous image we can observe that all LLMs have something called parameters, these are the internal weights that the model learns during training, helping it understand and generate language. The more a model has, the more complex and accurate it can be, but it also needs more memory to run.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Models with **7 billion parameters** need at least **8 GB of VRAM**.\n",
        "**13 billion parameters** require **16 GB of VRAM**.\n",
        "**33 billion parameters** need **32 GB of VRAM**.\n",
        "The higher the number of parameters, the more memory and computational power the model needs to function efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "And so that is why we are trying to use small LLMs for this practice, because they require a lot of computational resources, so by using 'llama3.2' and 'llava-phi3', both models with 3 billion parameters, we will only use at most 8 GB of VRAM. But if there are some issues with 'llama3.2' we can still use 'llama3.2:1b' the model with 1 billion parameters that requires less resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "So now let's talk about the models:\n",
        "**LLaMA 3.2** is part of the LLaMA series (Large Language Model Meta AI), designed to provide efficient language understanding and generation. Despite having fewer parameters than some larger models, it offers strong performance in NLP tasks, making it suitable for scenarios where both accuracy and resource efficiency are important.\n",
        "\n",
        "**LLaVA** (Large Language and Vision Assistant) models, like **LLaVA-Phi3** are multimodal models combining language and vision capabilities. It can interpret visual inputs like images and generate corresponding text, making it ideal for tasks that require both visual understanding and language generation, such as image captioning and answering visual-based questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**I will be using the llama3.2 model going onwards, you can change it for the smallest version if it is necessary for you, or you can try to run it on Kaggle where you can use online GPU resources for it.**"

In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",

After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (e.g., Llama3.2). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate."

        "LLM embeddings are dense vector representations of text generated by Large Language Models. These embeddings, like we have already seen in the lab, capture the semantic meaning and relationships between words, phrases, or even entire documents by mapping them into a high-dimensional space where similar pieces of text are placed closer together. What makes LLM embeddings special is that they are contextual and rich in meaning, meaning the same word can have different embeddings based on its surrounding context.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, the word **\"bank\"** would have different embeddings in the sentences **\"I sat by the river bank\"** and **\"I deposited money in the bank.\"** This ability to understand and encode context enables LLM embeddings to outperform traditional techniques (like TF-IDF or one-hot encoding) by providing a deeper, more nuanced representation of language.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, LLM embeddings are pre-trained on vast amounts of data, allowing them to generalize well across different tasks (like classification, clustering, or similarity detection) without the need for extensive retraining. This makes them highly valuable in many natural language processing tasks today.\n",

KNN is non-parametric, meaning it doesn’t assume a specific form for the underlying data distribution, and it classifies points based on their similarity to other points in the training set.

Instead of needing extensive training, the LLM uses these examples to understand the task and classify new inputs.

        "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
